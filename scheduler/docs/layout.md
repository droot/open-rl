# Where everything is

The short version: two CRDs define the API, one pure package makes the
placement decision, one reconciler drives Kubernetes, and everything else is
glue you can read once and trust.

Reading order for a first pass: `api/v1alpha1/workload_types.go` and
`claimledger_types.go` (the contract), then
`internal/placement/behavior_test.go` (what it promises), then `tiers.go` and
`placement.go` (the decision), then `workload_controller.go`'s `place()` (how
it touches Kubernetes). Everything else is in service of those.

Not in this module: the node-local time-slicer (who is *resident* right now)
is Python, in `src/accel_timeslicer/`, and ships with the FFT line along with
the API server's `src/server/scheduler_worker_manager.py`, which turns API
requests into Workload objects using the estimator's footprint.
